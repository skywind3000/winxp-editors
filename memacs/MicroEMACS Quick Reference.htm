=&gt;              MicroEMACS 3.8 Help screens             (01/18/87)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=&gt;              (2) DELETING & INSERTING

^R      Reverse search from cursor position.
^X S    Forward incremental search
^X R    Reverse incremental search
&lt;ALT&gt; S Search for the next occurence of the last string (IBM-PC only)
&lt;ALT&gt; R Search for the last occurence of the last string (IBM-PC only)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=&gt;              (4) REPLACING


M-R   Replace all instances of first typed-in string with second
typed-in string.  End each string with ESC.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=&gt;              (5) CAPITALIZING & TRANSPOSING

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=&gt;              (6) REGIONS & THE KILL BUFFER


M-&lt;spacebar&gt;    set MARK at current position
^X ^X           eXchange mark and cursor


A REGION will then be continuously-defined as the area between the mark and
the current cursor position.  The KILL BUFFER is the text which has been
most recently saved or deleted.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=&gt;              (7) COPYING AND MOVING


^W  Delete (Wipe) region                M-W     copy region to KILL buffer
^Y  Yankback save buffer at cursor
Generally, the procedure for copying or moving text is:
1)  Mark a REGION using M-&lt;spacebar&gt; at beginning and cursor at end.
2)  Delete it (with ^W) or copy it (with M-W) into the KILL buffer.
3)  Move the cursor to the desired location and yank it back (with ^Y).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=&gt;              (8) MODES OF OPERATION


^X M    Add mode in buffer              M-M    Add global mode
^X ^M   Delete mode in buffer           M-^M   Delete global mode
OVER            Replaces (overwrites) rather than inserts characters
WRAP            Turns on word wrap (automatic carraige return).
VIEW            Allows viewing file without insertion and deletion.
CMODE           Automatic indenting for C program entry
ASAVE           Automatic saving of current buffer
EXACT/MAGIC     Changes how search and replace commands work (see next page)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=&gt;              (9) SEARCH AND REPLACE MODES


EXACT   Upper/lower case is not ignored in searches
MAGIC   Regular pattern matching characters are active
.   Matches any one character
*   Matches any any number of the preceding character
^   Beginning of line        [ ]   Character class enclosure
